# The Witness Puzzle Solver and Generator

A tool for solving and generating puzzles inspired by the game [The Witness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_(2016_video_game)).

## What is it about?

The project recreates the unique puzzles from *The Witness*, where players navigate mazes following specific rules to reach the exit.

As for why I am doing this? I just love the game and really think making both a solver and generator for those difficult mechanics will be a good problem to tackle.

## Usage

This project is still at its beginnings and nothing has been defined yet.
The goal would be to have a GitHub Page where you would be able to solve a randomly generated puzzle each day.

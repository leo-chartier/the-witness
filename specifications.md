## Overview
### Description
I found my GitHub home page to be quite empty. As such, I decided to make it more lively by introducing an interactive game on it.

The game I will be recreating is one of my favorite puzzle games: The Witness by Jonathan Blow.

The game will then be embeded on my home page so everyone can play a new game daily.

## Deliverables
This project can be broken down into multiple deliverables:
1. Puzzle and solution verifyers
2. Interactive interface
3. Generator
4. Polyominos & Negative Polyomino mechanics
5. (Optimized solver)

### Scope
For completeness, every regular maze mechanics in the original game is to be included here as well. Special mechanics such as environmental clues or non-square mazes do not apply here and are out of scope. The polyminos are included but at a later stage of the development process due to their complexity.

The optimized solver is currently out of scope and may be created and worked on once the generator is fully working. In the meantime, considering the small sizes of the puzzles (generally 4x4, rarely more than 8x8), bruteforcing the solution will be sufficient.

A puzzle editor is out of scope. Some already exists such as [The Windmill](https://windmill.thefifthmatt.com/build). Being able to share puzzle from and to those engines is out of scope.
